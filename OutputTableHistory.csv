This issue manifests itself as occasional MDC Service Message: IAPS IOC 1A/1B INPUT BUS ERROR and/or IAPS IOC 2A/2B INPUT BUS ERROR. The status is ""LRU OK/INFO"" which should indicate there isn't anything the mechanic can do to fix this item. Generally this Service Message can be considered a nuisance but potentially it could be a real failure if there was a bad connection somewhere or an LRU had a bad UART.

This is a Collins known issue with ARINC output bus bit timing for VHF-422A/VHF-422C. This issue manifests itself as occasional MDC Service Message: IAPS IOC 1A/1B INPUT BUS ERROR and/or IAPS IOC 2A/2B INPUT BUS ERROR. The status is ""LRU OK/INFO"" which should indicate there isn't anything the mechanic can do to fix this item. Generally this Service Message can be considered a nuisance but potentially it could be a real failure if there was a bad connection somewhere or an LRU had a bad UART. The fact that this message is occasional should indicate that it is not a hard failure. 

This is a maintenance issue only; there are no cockpit faults posted or associated with these faults. ","Nuisance if occassional

The status is ""LRU OK/INFO"" which should indicate there isn't anything the mechanic can do to fix this item. Generally this Service Message can be considered a nuisance but potentially it could be a real failure if there was a bad connection somewhere or an LRU had a bad UART.

This is a Collins known issue with ARINC output bus bit timing for VHF-422A/VHF-422C. This issue manifests itself as occasional MDC Service Message: IAPS IOC 1A/1B INPUT BUS ERROR and/or IAPS IOC 2A/2B INPUT BUS ERROR. The status is ""LRU OK/INFO"" which should indicate there isn't anything the mechanic can do to fix this item. Generally this Service Message can be considered a nuisance but potentially it could be a real failure if there was a bad connection somewhere or an LRU had a bad UART. The fact that this message is occasional should indicate that it is not a hard failure.
