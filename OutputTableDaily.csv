FDR FAIL := [[L DCU Position * [[ ^FDR Valid + FDCU FAIL] * L Engine Running * R Engine Running]] * 1.0 Rising Edge] + (R DCU Position * XTALK FDR FAIL); 
Note: CAS msg logic above applies for DCU -107 & below. On DCU -108 & up, the ENG running is an OR logic, i.e. ENG1 or ENG2 running.

Conclusion, MDC msg can be logged in TAXI if both ENG running and beacon/strobe lights switch set to OFF. In these conditions the A/C is WonW, so the FDR is set to OFF causing ^FDR Valid and having both ENG running will trigger DCU L353b27 set thus MDC msg.

Gustavo to check why it is also logging as MDC Current msg if L353b27 needs both ENG running to be set (FDR CB open & ENG Running??).
Also per IXPF8 logic the bit will only set on 128wps config.","MDT Logic: DCU1 L353b27 set

Conclusion, MDC msg can be logged in TAXI if both ENG running and beacon/strobe lights switch set to OFF. In these conditions the A/C is WonW, so the FDR is set to OFF causing ^FDR Valid and having both ENG running will trigger DCU L353b27 set thus MDC msg.

The status is ""LRU OK/INFO"" which should indicate there isn't anything the mechanic can do to fix this item. Generally this Service Message can be considered a nuisance but potentially it could be a real failure if there was a bad connection somewhere or an LRU had a bad UART.

This is a Collins known issue with ARINC output bus bit timing for VHF-422A/VHF-422C. This issue manifests itself as occasional MDC Service Message: IAPS IOC 1A/1B INPUT BUS ERROR and/or IAPS IOC 2A/2B INPUT BUS ERROR. The status is ""LRU OK/INFO"" which should indicate there isn't anything the mechanic can do to fix this item. Generally this Service Message can be considered a nuisance but potentially it could be a real failure if there was a bad connection somewhere or an LRU had a bad UART. The fact that this message is occasional should indicate that it is not a hard failure. 

This is a maintenance issue only; there are no cockpit faults posted or associated with these faults. ","Nuisance if occassional
